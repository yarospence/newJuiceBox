# Block 34D - Improved Juicebox

For this project, you will be recreating the Juicebox API from scratch with the new technologies you've learned. 

You may structure your project as you wish as long as you meet the requirements.

# In this exercise, we are demonstrating how to create an API 
we will be build a simple RESTful API using the blockchain as a storage layer


# Use every step that we have been taught 
    -write our smart contract that will act as our storage layer

    -create a function for each:
     {setPost} {getPost} [getAllPosts] {updatePosts} {deletePosts}

    -write the endpoints that will interact with the smart contract
        retrieve data securely on the blockchain

    -finally, test API by sending requests using postman 
        verify and securely retrieve stored data from the blockchain
