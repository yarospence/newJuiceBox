# Demonstrating how to create an API 
we will be build a simple RESTful API using the blockchain as a storage layer


# Use every step that we have been taught 
    -write our smart contract that will act as our storage layer

    -create a function for each:
     {setPost} {getPost} [getAllPosts] {updatePosts} {deletePosts}

    -write the endpoints that will interact with the smart contract
        retrieve data securely on the blockchain

    -finally, test API by sending requests using postman 
        verify and securely retrieve stored data from the blockchain
